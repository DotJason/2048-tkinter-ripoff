# squares
A square sequence closing in on mouse pointer.

# langton

# scroll
A map you can (kind of) scroll with your mouse.

Harder to implement than it seems at first, still becomes laggy at field size ~1000.

# deep

Try setting cell side to 1 and width/height to 1000 for an interesting result.

# paint
